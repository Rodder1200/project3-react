        Why is it always so difficult to find what you are looking
        for in dentistry? Whether it is the latest advancement in technology
        or techniques or simply a review or understanding of the vast
        amount of products? Perhaps finding someone to just fix your broken
        equipment or simply hiring new staff or looking for that new job? 
      </p>
      <p class="c-about__item">
        Our mission is to give every dental professional the possibility
        to discuss and share all aspects of their profession, their practice
        and their business. We aim to make the world of dentistry easy and
        accessible, so every dental professional can find what they are
        looking for quickly and easily all in one place.
